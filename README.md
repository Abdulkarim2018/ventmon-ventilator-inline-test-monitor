# ventilator-test-lung
Design for a hardware "lung" instumented to be a test fixture for an emergency ventilator

## Progress

This is an emergeny project in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are in a learning mode.

This project seeks to create open-source designs for both physcial test lungs and "certifiers"

## Physical Test Lungs

I believe that a test lung is meant to provide a resistance to inflation which models a human lung.  An example of a purchasble device is:

## Certifiers

An example of a certifier, including an explanation of its functionality is here: [Alnor-4070 Certifier  Flow Analyzer](https://www.globaltestsupply.com/product/alnor-4070-certifier-flow-analyzer-system?gclid=Cj0KCQjwjcfzBRCHARIsAO-1_OpV87HtnO7sJXdt92m7W3j69KOddmV-gV0eCZjfKlHTDMWsUCqYe4kaAoaQEALw_wcB)
